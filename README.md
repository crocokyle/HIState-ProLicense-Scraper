# HIState-ProLicense-Scraper
Powershell script that builds a list of specified professional licenses from the Hawaii State Database at https://pvl.ehawaii.gov/pvlsearch/

Feel free to stop the script before it iterates through all 20,000 license numbers ;)

Script example searches for Professional Engineers(PE) with a subtype of Structural.
